**What is Selenium?**

Selenium is a portable framework and a popular tool for web app testing. It is compatible with multiple programming languages such as Python, C#, and Java. You can use those languages to perform various tasks with Selenium, such as creating a test script. Still, most users prefer to use Java with this framework because itâ€™s more user-friendly than the rest. 

Selenium is not a single software application. It is a suite of various tools that you can use to perform different sorts of testing.


Selenium has the following tools in its suite:

1.Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

2.Selenium WebDriver

3.Selenium Client API

4.Selenium Remote Control (Deprecated)

5.Selenium Grid
